## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of several fundamental and advanced computer science algorithms, developed for the *Data Structures and Algorithms II* (EDA 2) course. The project focuses on efficiency, memory management, and the practical application of abstract data types (TADs) in C++.

## Implemented Structures & Exercises
The project is divided into 10 specialized exercises covering:
* **Priority Queues:** Custom `MinHeap` implementation for efficient data retrieval.
* **Graph Algorithms:** Solving connectivity and pathfinding problems.
* **Custom TADs:** Implementation of Tuples, Lists, and specialized containers.
* **Optimization:** Algorithmic solutions designed to pass strict time and memory complexity constraints.

## Testing & Validation
The repository includes a comprehensive `tests/` directory with:
* **Input/Output Files:** Multiple test cases per exercise (`.in.txt` / `.out.txt`).
* **Stress Testing:** Cases with up to 1,000,000 elements to ensure O(log n) or O(n) performance.

## Technical Stack
* **Language:** C++
* **Paradigm:** Procedural & Object-Oriented (TADs)
* **Tools:** GCC/G++, Standard Template Library (STL) basics, and manual memory management.

## Key Files
* `tads/`: Implementation of core data structures.
* `ejercicio1.cpp` to `ejercicio10.cpp`: Specific problem-solving logic.
* `funciones/`: Utility functions for data manipulation.
